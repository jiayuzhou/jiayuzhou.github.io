        <strong>Workshop Description:</strong><br/>
        <!-- objectives, content, topics of interest -->
        The proposed workshop (BigTraffic) aims to bring the attention of researchers to the various data mining and machine learning methods for traffic studies, and therefore promote AI research. 
        The availability of massive amount of travel data has provided unique opportunities for data-driven intelligent transportation systems. Even though traffic patterns are extensively studied from both the marcoscopic traffic level (e.g., urban traffic patterns) and microscropic traffic level (e.g., behavior of individual drivers/vehicles), the small-scale data used in prior studies has greatly restricted the complexity of models and thus the capability of capturing complicated dynamics in traffic patterns. The availability of big traffic data has enabled a wide spectrum of powerful machine learning and data mining methodologies to be applied to traffic studies. <p/>

      <p>
        This workshop focuses on applying novel as well as existing machine learning and data mining methodologies for addressing key challenges in traffic studies. Indeed there are many established conferences such as NIPS and ICML that focus on the study of theoretical properties of machine learning algorithms. On the other hand, the established transportation journals focus on different aspects of designing and implementing intelligent transportation systems. We believe that there is a gap between these two ends, and this workshop aims at bridging the recent advances of machine learning and data mining algorithms to studying big traffic data and improving traffic studies. Since many modern traffic models are data driven, machine learning and data mining approaches are deeply rooted in their foundations. As such, there is an urgent need for researchers from the two communities to jointly work on 1) what are the recent developed machine learning and data mining techniques that can be leveraged to address challenges in traffic studies, and 2) from challenges in traffic studies, what are the practical research directions in the machine learning and data mining community.
      <p/>

      <p>
        We encourage submissions on a variety of topics, including but not limited to:<br/>


        (1) Novel machine learning algorithms for traffic studies, e.g., new trajectory analysis algorithms, new traffic state estimation algorithms, new data-driven algorithms for map matching. <br/>
        (2) Novel approaches for applying existing machine learning algorithms, e.g., applying bilinear models, sparse learning, metric learning, neural networks and deep learning, for traffic studies. <br/>
        (3) Novel optimization algorithms and analysis for improving traffic data processing, e.g., parallel/distributed optimization techniques and efficient stochastic gradient descent. <br/>
        (4) Industrial practices and implementations of big traffic data modeling, e.g., feature engineering, model ensemble, and lessons from large-scale implementations of intelligent transportation systems.<br/>

        <br/>
        We believe that advancements on these topics will benefit a variety of algorithm and application domains.
